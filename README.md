Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

The main goal for this project is to predict with a level of certainty the projections of sales for the next 6 weeks, since the retail chain wish to annalyze how to improve the performance of stores by figuring out which one have a better performance or not. This project aims to indicate the health of retail chain and its future.
